HierarchicalProperties
======================

Hierarchical Properties is a small project for a parser and serializer of enriched properties for Java 7+. 

It contains a parser for properties in a tree of nodes. It supports also node references and also allows includes via a pre-processor.

This project is not yet in alpha stage, because the serializer is not yet there.
